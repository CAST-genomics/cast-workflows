# Bash configuration for AoU terminal
This configuration makes the bash prompt and `ls` command output more human friendly by shortening the bash prompt and adding colors to the prompt and `ls` output.

To add this to your terminal, add the following line to the beginning of the `~/.bashrc` file:
```
source /path/to/bash_profile.sh
```

The `bash_profile.sh` file will be called every time a new terminal window is created and you will have shortened and color-coded bash prompt and `ls` output.
